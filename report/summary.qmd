# Summary {#sec-summary}

## Overview

In this reprt, we thoroughly assessed the formal RE model by @beisbart_making_2021 by numerical investigation. We ran computer simulations for a broad spectrum of model parameters, initial conditions and with different model variants. In the following paragraphs we summarize the most important findings with respect to the metrics described in @sec-intro-metrics.

**Global optima and fixed points**

In @sec-go-and-fp, we investigated whether fixed points are global optima (GO efficiency), and conversely, whether global optima are reachable by equilibration processes (GO reachability).

- Overall, GO efficiency is high for semi-globally optimizing models and medium-high for locally optimizing models. 
- GO efficiency drops for locally optimizing models with the size of the sentence pool.
- For $\alpha_a < \alpha_s$, GO efficiency of the `LinearLocalRE` model is as high as of the models `QuadraticGlobalRE` and `LinearGlobalRE`.
- GO reachability is low to medium for all models.
- All but the `QuadraticGlobalRE` model perform worse concerning GO reachabiity with an increase in the size of the sentence pool.
- The `QuadraticGlobalRE` model outperforms all other models on average.
- The`LinearLocalRE` model reaches a higher GO efficiency than the `QuadraticLocalRE` model, but it is the other way around with respect to GO reachability.


**Full RE states**

In @sec-full-re-states, we explored whether fixed points and global optima attain full RE states, i.e., globally optimal states in which the theory fully and exlusively accounts for the commitments. 

- Overall, the relative shares of full RE states among global optima and fixed points are rather low.
- Heatmaps reveal combinations of weights for `GlobalQuadraticRE`, `GlobalLinearRE` and `LinearLocalRE`, where the relative share of full RE states among the outputs is acceptable. 
- There is a sightly negative trend for the relative shares of full RE states among global optima and fixed points (result perspective) for increasing sentence pool sizes. 
- The relative share of full RE fixed points (process perspective) of`LinearLocalRE` is not affected by the sentence pool size.


**Consistency**

In @sec-commitment-consistency, we assessed different aspects of consistency conduciveness of the  model variants.

- The overall relative shares of consistent outputs, inconsistency-eliminating and consistency-preserving cases, as well as consistent unions are satisfactorily high for all model variants.
- In view increasing sentence pool sizes, `LinearLocalRE` performs best with respect to all examined aspects of consistency. 
- There are regions of weight configurations ($\alpha_{A} > \alpha_{F}$) that yield desirable behaviour concerning consistency across all model variants. 
- A salient "tipping line" in heatmaps of linear model variants marks off regions of weight configurations that yield funamentally different behavior. It can be explained by analytical results in @sec-appendix-tipping.

**Extreme measure values**

In @sec-extreme-values, we nvestigated whether global optima and fixed points yield extreme values in the normalized measures $A$, $F$ and $S$.

- Overall, there are no surprising observations: Increasing the weight of a specific measure leads to more outputs maximizing the corresponding measure.


## Appendices

The results concerning the main metrics for are complemented by additional material in various appendices.

**The tipping line of linear model variants**

In @sec-appendix-tipping, we provide analytical results concerning a "tipping line" in linear model variants that help to explain various observations in the report.

- For $\alpha_{A} > \alpha_{F}$, global optima of linear model variants always achieve full and exclusive account ($A(C, T) = 1$).
- For $\alpha_{F} > \alpha_{A}$, the commitments of global optima of linear model variants are always maximally faithful to the initial commitments ($F(C\,\vert\,C_{0}) = 1$).
- These results also pertain to fixed points of linear model variants (CHECK)


It is important to note that we cannot conclude from this tipping behavior of linear models with repsect to some metrics, that the liner model variants do not allow for more fine-grained trade-offs between the measures for account and faithfulness (and ultimately, turn this into a point that speaks against the linear model variants). Results from @sec-go-and-fp make it clear that weight configurations yield different sets of global despite there being uniform with respect to model validation metrics.

**Trivial endpoints**

In @sec-appendix-sec-appendix-trivial, we analyzed whether the model vriants yield "trivial" outputs, i.e. global optima or fixed points that consists of a singleton theory and a singleton commitment.

- Overall, the relative share of trivial gobal optima and fixed points (result perspective) is very low for quadratic model variants
- Linear model variants exhibit substantially more trivial global optima, but the relative shares are still low.
- `LinearLocalRE` exhibits a substantial share of trivial fixed points in the process perspective, but not for the result perspectve.
- The relative shares of trivial global optima or fixed points tend to decrease with increasing sentence pool sizes.
- In quadratic model variants, the configuration of weights have a small impact on the relative shares of trivial endpoints.


## Conclusions

The multifacetted analysis of the formal model RE in this report makes it difficult to draw universal conclusion or establish hard and fast rules for selecting one of the model variants. In general, we did not find conclusive evidence to exclude a model variant as a future reference point. First, each model variant meets the metrics to a sufficient degree for some range of simulation setups. Next, undesirable behavior (failing with respect to some metric) cannot be attributed to a model variant on its own, but may result from a combination of other aspects of a simulation setup, such as the randomly generated dialectical structures including the sentence pool size, the specific configuration of weights, or the also randomly chosen initial commitments.

This does not mean, that there are no differences between model variants at all, or that we cannot observe any tendencies that could lead us to favor some model variant over another.




## Outlook

The present state of the technical report is but a starting point for future lines of research. Below, you find a selection of possible next steps that came to our mind during working with the models. 

Note that the current Python implementation of the formal model is designed to facilitate extending the model (as demonstrated by the three model variants included in this report). Various components of the formal model, e.g. the measures for desiderata in the achievement function, can be changed with few lines of code (see XXX).

### The neighborhood depth of locally optimizing model variants

The local model variants examine available candidate positions for adjustments during RE processes in a small neighborhood of the current positon. For this report, this search depth was confined to adjusting a single sentence per adjustemt step. 
A particular shortcoming of such a small neighborhood depths of local model variants is that they may "miss" sensible adjustments that involve arguments with more than one premise.^[Results that might suggest such a shortoming of local model variants can be found in @fig-rel-fpgo-fp-by-np-rp and @fig-rel-fpgo-fp-by-np-pp.]

It is important to note that considering larger neighborhood depths reintroduces an exponential growth of the search space depending on the size of the sentence pool. However, this defies an original motivation to include locally optimizing models in this report, as they render future examples of larger sentence pool size computationally feasible.
In view of this, new model variations may be an interesting line of future exporation. For example, one could devise variations of locally optimizing models that allow to "backtrack" on branches, if adjustments in a different branch prove to bettter at some point.

### The measure of systematicity



### The inferential density of dialectical structure

We did not present results with repsect to the inferential density of the randomly generated dialectical structures (for the definition, see @sec-intro-dia). The dialectical structure determines relevant aspects at the outet of RE processes or global optmization (e.g. the number of complete and consistent positions). Hence, it may be interesting to treat the inferential density as an independent variable to gain new insights about the model's behaviour.

### Extrapolation to larger sentence pool sizes

We considered a small range of sentence pool sizes (ranging from 6 to 9 unnegated sentences). It is quite clear that applications of the formal model of RE to somewhat realistic examples will involve much more sentences.

As it stands, the results of this report provide no solid basis to extrapolate findings to larger sentence pool sizes, e.g. about the attainment of global optima by locally optimizing model variants. However, this is an important step towards working with larger sentence pool sizes, for which the (semi)-global optimization of the original model of @beisbart_making_2021 is no longer computationally feasible. In these cases, some form of local optimization has to take over, but the prospects of using locally optimizing have to be evaluated carefully beforehand. To arrive at better estimates, one would need dedicated ensembles of simulations that comprise a wider, but still computationally feasible, range of sentence pool sizes for which results of (semi)-globally and locally model variants can be compared.
