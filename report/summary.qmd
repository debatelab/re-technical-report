    + Systematische Analyse alternativer Systematicity measures.
    + Ist inferentielle Dichte vlt. auch eine interessante unabhängige variable?

<!--
In general, we did not find conclusive evidence to exclude a model variant as a future reference point. Each model variant satisfies the consolidation criteria to a sufficient degree for a wide range of configurations. At this point, undesirable behavior (failing with respect to some criterion) cannot be attributed to a model variant on its own, but may result from a combination of other aspects of a configuration, such as unfavourable dialectical structures, extreme weightings or hopelessly absurd initial commitments. This does not mean, that there are no differences at all or no tendencies in favor of some model variants. Linear models tend to perform better as quadratic variants with respect to many criteria.

**Remarks on the interpretation or explanation of results** 

Due to the wide range of required inputs for a configuration, salient behaviour may depend on the features of any of i) - iv) or a combination thereof, and it is difficult to separate all dimension at once. In order to disentangle model variants  and iii) the weightings, heatmaps proved to be a useful tool and provided insightful plots with respect to various evaluation criteria. The other inputs involve much more features, which could explain salient behaviour, but are much harder to separate:

ii) features of dialectical structures include the size of the sentence pool, number of arguments, number of premises per argument, inferential density, number of complete consistent extensions, number of tau-truths.
iv) features of initial commitments include their size, dialectical consistency, dialectical closure, number of complete consistent extensions, the minimal axiomatization

In addition to the exploration of ensembles, there is a growing number of analytical results for both linear and quadratic models. Linear models have a ([tipping line](https://git.scc.kit.edu/debatelab/re-python/-/blob/master/projects/ensemble_study_02/documents/linear_models_tipping_line.md)), below which the weight for faithfulness makes no difference in the equilibration process towards fixed points ([see here](https://github.com/debatelab/re-studies/blob/master/projects/ensemble_study_02/documents/linear_models_tipping_line.md)). In quadratic models, the squaring of Hamming distances makes "midpoints" to attractors ([quadratic tipping](https://github.com/debatelab/re-studies/blob/master/projects/ensemble_study_02/documents/Quadratic_Tipping-Line.md)). Dependending on the interpretation of the consequences of such results, a model or specific configurations for a model may be preferred.

<!--
If conceptual clarity is to be taken into account, pure systematicity (number of a theories sentences normalized by the size of the sentence pool)  may be preferred to default systematicity, which involves normalization by the size of a theory's closure (its "scope"). In the former case, pure systematicity may safely be called "simplicity" and other virtues contributing to the systematicityof a theory (e.g. scope) should be reserved for model extensions. In this line of thought, `LinearPureSystematicityRE` can be seen as the absolute minimal model variant, that is extended by the other variants by squaring measures, refining systematicity, or both.
