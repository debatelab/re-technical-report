# Extreme values for account, systematicity, and faithfulness {#sec-extreme-values}

## Background {#sec-extreme-values-background}

In this chapter, we examine the conditions under which the desiderata account ($A$), systematicity ($S$) and faithfulness ($F$) yield extreme value (i.e., $0$ or $1$).


Maximal account ($A(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{T}) = 1$) means that the theory $\mathcal{T}$ fully and exclusively accounts for the commitments $\mathcal{C}$. Full and exclusive account is a condition for full RE states. Conversely, $A(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{T}) = 0$ holds if a theory completely fails to account for commitments---that is, if for every sentence in the commitments, the theory's closure does not contain this sentence.

The measure of systematicity for a theory $\mathcal{T}$ is defined as follows:

$$
S(\mathcal{T}) = G\left(\frac{\vert \mathcal{T}\vert -1}{\vert\overline{\mathcal{T}}\vert }\right)
$$

with $G=1-x^2$ for quadratic models and $G=1-x$ for linear models.

Hence, $S(\mathcal{T}) = 1$ if and only if $\vert \mathcal{T}\vert = 1$ (i.e., if and only if $\mathcal{T}$ is a singleton theory, e.g., $\mathcal{T} =\lbrace s\rbrace$). Note that it does not matter whether $G$ is linear or quadratic. Furthermore, we have $S(T) = 0$ if and only if $\mathcal{T}=\emptyset$ by definition.

$F(\mathcal{C} \vert \mathcal{C}_{0}) = 1$ holds if and only if the initial commitments $\mathcal{C}_{0}$ are a subset of the commitments $\mathcal{C}$ (expansions of the initial commitments are not penalized). $F(\mathcal{C} \vert \mathcal{C}_{0})$ attains the minimal value of $0$ if every sentence of the initial commitments $\mathcal{C}_{0}$ is missing in or contradicted by the commitments $\mathcal{C}$.

<!-- Extreme values for systematicity are not included. $S(T) = 1$ holds if and only if $T$ is a singleton. $S(T) = 0$ is no serious option, because it is reserved for the empty theory $T=\emptyset$.-->


<!--
## Method

During the ensemble generation, the values for account and faithfulness are calculated for every global optimum and fixed point for each simulation setup.
The systematicity value has not been stored, but extreme values can (easily) be determined by considering the length (i.e. the number of sentences) in the theory. 


Note that the information about the values of measures has not been stored in the dataframe for fixed points from all branches. Thus, the current study only includes results concerning unique fixed points reached from each simulation setup

### Overall

#### Minimal values

There is no simulation setup that resulted in a global optimum or a fixed point with a minimal value for account, systematicity or faithfulness. Consequently, we can exclude the consideration of minimal values from the subsequent analysis.

This is a desirable result, as minimal values for $A$, $F$ and $S$ would constitute quite strange behaviour of the model variants, at least in the range of weights we considered in this study, for we omitted $\alpha$-weight combinations with zero-valued $\alpha$ weights. Take, for instance, faithfulness: $F(\mathcal{C}\,\vert\,\mathcal{C}_{0}) = 0$ would mean that an agent completely departed from their initial commitments $\mathcal{C}_{0}$, which could be interpreted as changing the subject matter. To the extent that faithfulness matters to some degree (i.e., $\alpha_F\neq 0$), we expect that fixed points and global optima take faithfulness into account (in the sense of $F(\mathcal{C}\,\vert\,\mathcal{C}_{0}) \neq 0$ for fixed point commitments or global optima commitments respectively).

![Relative shares of unique fixed points (result perspective) maximizing the desiderata measures for account, systematicity and faithfulness](figures/overall_max_values_fp_rp){#fig-overall-max-values-fp}

**Observations**

- Outputs of linear model variants maximize the measures more often than the outcomes of quadratic models.
- Outputs of all model variants maximize the measure of systematicity more often than the measures for account or faithfulness, excepting fixed points from `LinearLocalRE` (@fig-overall-max-values-fp). 
  + It may be easier to maximize $S$ due to the fact that the measure does discriminate singleton theories on the basis of their scope ($\vert\bar{\mathcal{T}}\vert$). Thus, there may be many cases in which at least somewhat attractive singleton theories significantly shape the subsequent process of adjustments or the outcome of global optimization.

![Relative share of fixed points (result perspective) maximizing the measure for faithfulness grouped by model variant and sentence pool size.](figures/rel_max_fp_faithfulness_by_sp_rp){#fig-max-faithfulness-fp-sp-rp}

**Observations**

- The global optima of both quadratic and linear model variants  maximize account (@fig-max-account-go-sp-rp) and faithfulness (@fig-max-faithfulness-go-sp-rp) less frequently for larger sentence pool sizes.
- This tendency is less pronounced for fixed points (result perspective) in @fig-max-account-fp-sp-rp and @fig-max-faithfulness-fp-sp-rp , respectively.
- The relative share of fixed points (result perspective) that maximize systematcity is not affected by the sentence pool size for global model variants (@fig-max-systematicity-fp-sp-rp). In contrast this relative share decreases with increasing sentence pool sizes for local model variants. 

### Grouped by configuration of weights

#### Account

![Relative share of fixed points (result perspective) maximizing the measure for account grouped by model variant and configuration of weights.](figures/rel_fp_max_account_rp){#fig-hm-max-account-fp}

**Observation**

- Linear model variants exhibit a "tipping line". For $\alpha_{A} > \alpha_{F}$ global optima and fixed points always maximize the measure for account. For an explanation, see @sec-appendix-tipping.
- Quadratic model variants exhibit a gradient with increasing relative shares for higher values of $\alpha_{A}$.

#### Systematicity

![Relative share of global optima maximizing the measure for systematicity grouped by model variant and configuration of weights.](figures/rel_go_max_systematicity_rp){#fig-hm-max-systematicity-go}

![Relative share of fixed points (result perspective) maximizing the measure for systematicity grouped by model variant and configuration of weights.](figures/rel_fp_max_systematicity_rp){#fig-hm-max-systematicity-fp}

**Observations**

- For all model variants and outputs, we can observe a gradient of increasing relative shares of outputs with maximal systematicity for increasing values of $\alpha_{S}$.
- Moreover, the relative share also increases for decreasing weights for $\alpha_{A}$. If account does not receive much weight, the theory can be optimized with respect to systematicity more independently of the commitments, even if $\alpha_{S}$ is low.

#### Faithfulness

- Quadratic model variants exhibit a gradient with increasing relative shares for higher values of $\alpha_{F}$.


## Conclusion

Many observations in this chapter are not surprising. It is to be expected that increasing the weight results in higher relatives shares of maximized measures. Nonetheless, this is a reassuring result from the viewpoint of model evaluation, indcating that configuring weights has forseeable consequences.

The high relative shares of outputs maximizing the measure for systematicity may be a consequence of a shortcoming in the measure for systematicity. If $\vert\mathcal{T}\vert = 1$, then $S(\mathcal{T}) = 1$ irrespective of $\vert\overline{\mathcal{T}}\vert$. That is the measure for systematictiy does not discriminate between singleton theories on the basis of their scope ($\overline{\mathcal{T}}$). This renders all singleton theories equally and maximally attractive according to the measure of systematicity. For another consequence of frequently maximizing the measure for systematicity, see @sec-appendix-trivial.

Further exploration is required to provide full explanations for the more salient observations. For example, one could analyze the "evolution" of theories during RE processes.^[This information is already available in the data.] Are singleton theories chosen in the first adjustment step and not altered afterwards? Or do RE processes set out with larger theories and are elements remove subsequently?
