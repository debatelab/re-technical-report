# Extreme values for account, systematicity, and faitfulness {#sec-extreme-values}

## Background {#sec-extreme-values-background}
In this study, we examine extreme values from measures that operationalize RE desiderata in the formal model of RE: account, systematicity and faithfulness.

$A(C, T) = 1$ means that the theory $T$ fully and exclusively accounts for the commitments $C$. Full and exclusive account is a condition for full RE states. Conversely, $A(C, T) = 0$ holds if a theory completely fails to account for commitments, that is, for every sentence in the commitments the closure theory does not contain this sentence, or contradicts the theory.

The measure of systematicity for a theory $\mathcal{T}$ is defined as follows:
$$
S(\mathcal{T}) = G(\frac{\vert \mathcal{T}\vert -1}{\vert\overline{\mathcal{T}}\vert })
$$

Hence, $S(\mathcal{T}) = 1$ if and only if $\vert \mathcal{T}\vert = 1$, i.e., $\mathcal{T}$ is a singleton theory, e.g., $\mathcal{T} =\lbrace s\rbrace$. Note that it does not matter whether $G$ is linear or quadratic. Furthermore, $S(T) = 0$ if and only if $\mathcal{T}=\emptyset$ by definition.


$F(C \vert C_{0}) = 1$ holds if and only if the initial committments $C_{0}$ are a subset of the commitments $C$ (expansions of the initial commitments are not penalized). $F(C \vert C_{0})$ attains the minimal value of 0, if every sentence of the initial commitments $C_{0}$ is missing in or contradicted by the commitments $C$.

<!-- Extreme values for systematicity are not included. $S(T) = 1$ holds if and only if $T$ is a singleton. $S(T) = 0$ is no serious option, because it is reserved for the empty theory $T=\emptyset$.-->


<!--
## Method

During the ensemble generation, the values for account and faithfulness are calculated for every global optimum and fixed point for each simulation setup.
The systematicity value has not been stored, but extreme values can (easily) be determined by considering the length (i.e. the number of sentences) in the theory. 


Note that the information about the values of measures has not been stored in the dataframe for fixed points from all branches. Thus, the current study only includes results concerning unique fixed points reached from each simulation setup

### Overall

#### Minimal values

There is no simulation setup which resulted in a global optimum or a fixed point that has a minimal value for the measure of account, systematicity or faithfulness. Consequently, we can exclude the consideration of minimal values from the subsequent analysis.

This is a desirable result, as minimal values for would constitute quite strange behaviour of the model variants. For example, $F(C\,\vert\,C_{0}) = 0$ would mean that an agent completely departed from their initial commitments $C_{0}$, which could amount to the undesirable outcome of changing the subject matter.

**Observations**

- Outputs of linear model variants maximize the measures more often than the outcomes of quadratic models.
- Outputs of all model variants maximize the measure of systematicity more often than the measures for account or faithfulness, excepting fixed points from `LinearLocalRE` (@fig-overall-max-values-fp)

## Conclusion

Many observations in this chapter are not surprising. It is to be expected that increasing the weight results in higher relatives shares of maximized measures. Nonetheless, this is a reassuring result from the viewpoint of model evaluation, indcating that configuring weights has forseeable consequences.

The high relative shares of outputs maximizing the measure for systematicity may be a consequence of a shortcoming in the measure for systematicity. If $\vert\mathcal{T}\vert = 1$, then $S(\mathcal{T}) = 1$ irrespective of $\vert\overline{\mathcal{T}}\vert$. That is the measure for systematictiy does not discriminate between singleton theories on the basis of their scope ($\overline{\mathcal{T}}$). This renders all singleton theories equally and maximally attractive according to the measure of systematicity. For another consequence of frequently maximizing the measure for systematicity, see @sec-appendix-trivial.
