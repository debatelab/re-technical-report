# Trivial Endpoints {#sec-appendix-trivial}

## Background
A "trivial" endpoint is a fixed point or a global optimum that consists of a singleton theory (e.g. $T=\lbrace s_{1}\rbrace$) and a singleton commitment (e.g. $C = \lbrace s_{1}\rbrace$). 

Such outcomes are not bad per se, but they may be indicative of the model exploiting shortcomings in the underlying measures. In particular, "trivial" endpoints may be a consequence of the original model's shortcoming concerning the measure of systematicity, which and does not discriminate between singleton theories on the basis of the scope of theories. Note that the same shortcoming also applies to the model variants explored in this report.

**Observations**

- Overall, the relative share of trivial gobal optima (@tbl-trivial-go) and fixed points (result perspective @tbl-trivial-fp-rp) is very low for quadratic model variants
- Linear model variants exhibit substantially more trivial global optima, but the relative shares are still low.
- `LinearLocalRE` exhibits a substantial share of trivial fixed points in the process perspective (@tbl-trivial-fp-pp), but not for the result perspectve (@tbl-trivial-fp-rp).  This indicates that relatively many branches lead to trivial fixed points.

![Relative share of trivial fixed points (result perspective) grouped by model variant and sentence pool size](figures/rel_fp_trivial_by_sp_rp){#fig-trivial-fp-sp-rp}

![Relative share of trivial fixed points (process perspective) grouped by model variant and sentence pool size](figures/rel_fp_trivial_by_sp_pp){#fig-trivial-fp-sp-pp}

**Observations**

- The relative shares of trivial global optima or fixed points tend to decrease with increasing sentence pool sizes.
- A notable exception to this trend is `LinearLocalRE` in the process perspective (@fig-trivial-fp-sp-pp)

### Results Grouped by Configuration of Weights

![Relative share of trivial global optima  grouped by model variant and weight configuration](figures/rel_trivial_go_rp){#fig-trivial-go-hm}

![Relative share of trivial fixed points (result perspective)  grouped by model variant and weight configuration](figures/rel_trivial_fp_rp){#fig-trivial-fp-rp-hm}

![Relative share of trivial fixed points (process perspective)  grouped by model variant and weight configuration](figures/rel_trivial_fp_pp){#fig-trivial-fp-pp-hm}

**Observations**

- In quadratic model variants, the configuration of weights have a small impact on the relative shares of trivial endpoints.
- Linear model variants tend to produce higher relative shares of trivial endpoints for low values of $\alpha_{F}$ (tipping line?) and high values of  $\alpha_{S}$.
