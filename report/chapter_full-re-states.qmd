# Full RE states {#sec-full-re-states}

## Background

A theory-commitment-pair $(C, T)$ is a *full RE state* iff 

1. it is a global optimum according to the achievement function, and 
2. the theory $T$ fully and exlusively accounts for the commitments $C$.


<!--
## Method

Formally and irrespecitve of the model variant, full and exclusive account means $C = \overline{T}$, or equivalenty, $A(C, T) = 1$. During the generation of an ensemble, we can store for every global optima and for every fixed point resulting from a simulation setup, whether it satisfies conditions i) and ii) of full RE states, i) being trivially satisfied by global optima. For the relative shares we can consider ratio between the number of full RE states among global optima (fixed points) and the total number of global optima (fixed points) per configuration.

**Observations**
<!--
- The relative share of full RE states among global optima  is identical for `QuadraticGlobalRE` and `QuadraticLocalRE`, as well as for `LinearGlobalRE` and `LinearLocalRE` in @tbl-full-re-go and @fig-overall-full-re-go. This is to be expected because the local model variants rely on their global counterparts to determine global optima.
--> 
- The relative share of full RE states among global optima is substantially higher for linear model variants than for quadratic models (@fig-overall-full-re-go).
- Even though local model variants rely on their global counterparts to determine global optima, small differences between corresponding variants in @tbl-full-re-go arise due to the exclusions of different erroneous runs.

![Relative share of full RE states among fixed points (result perspective) grouped by model variant](figures/full_re_fp_rp){#fig-overall-full-re-fp-setups}

**Observations**

- The relative share of unique full RE fixed points (@fig-overall-full-re-fp-setups) is lower than the corresponding results for global optima (@fig-overall-full-re-go). This is not surprising as fixed points are reached through semi-globalLY or locally optimizing processes, which cover a restricted search space in contrast to global optimization.

![Relative share of full RE states among fixed points (process perspective) grouped by model variant](figures/full_re_fp_pp){#fig-overall-full-re-fp-branches}

**Observations**

- The relative share of full RE fixed points  (process perspective, @fig-overall-full-re-fp-branches) are similar to the corresponding results for the result perspective (@fig-overall-full-re-fp-setups), for `QuadraticGlobalRE`, `LinearGlobalRE`, an `QuadraticLocalRE`, excepting `LinearLocalRE`. 
- For `LinearLocalRE`, the relative share of full RE fixed points is significantly higher when consdering the fixed points from all branches (process perspective) rather than unique fixed points (result perspective). This means that a relatively higher share of branches lead to full RE fixed points than to non-full-RE fixed points.
- The relative share of full RE fixed points for `LinearLocalRE` (@fig-overall-full-re-fp-branches), even exceeds the relative share of full RE global optima for linear model variants (@fig-overall-full-re-go).
- The number of fixed points in the process perspective (@tbl-full-re-fp-branches) is only slightly higher than the number in the result perspective (@tbl-full-re-fp-setups) for `QuadraticGlobalRE` and `LinearGlobalRE`. In contrast, the number of fixed points from all branches is substantially higher than the number of unique fixed points for `QuadraticLocalRE`, and even more so for `LinearLocalRE`.

### REsults Grouped by Configuration of Weights

![Relative share of full RE states among global optima grouped by model variant and configuration of weights](figures/hm_rel_go_full_re_rp){#fig-hm-full-re-go}

**Observations**

- Linear model variants exhibit a "tipping line" (see @sec-appendix-tipping). For $\alpha_{A} > \alpha_{F}$, the relative share of full RE global optima is 1.0, i.e., all global optima are full RE states.
- Quadratic model variants have a smooth transition between low and high relative shares, and they have a "hotspot" for very high values of $\alpha_{A}$. This result is made plausible by the fact that full RE states require a maximal value for the measure of account, i.e, $A(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{T}) = 1$. High values for $\alpha_{A}$ benefit the fulfillment of this requirement.

![Relative share of full RE states among fixed points from all branches grouped by model variant and configuration of weights.](figures/hm_rel_fp_full_re_pp){#fig-hm-full-re-fp-branches}

**Observations**

- Linear model variants do not exhibit the tipping line for fixed points (@fig-hm-full-re-fp-setups and @fig-hm-full-re-fp-branches)
- Linear model variants have high relative shares for low faihtfulness, moderate account and high (but non-extreme) weights for systematicity.
- There are only small differences between relative share of full RE states among unique fixed points (@fig-hm-full-re-fp-setups) and fixed points from all branches (@fig-hm-full-re-fp-branches).
- `QuadratGlobalRE` exhibits its highest relative shares of full RE fixed points for moderately high values for $\alpha_{A}$ and very low values for $\alpha_{S}$.

## Conclusion

Overall, the relative shares of full RE states among global optima and fixed points is not overwhelming, but heatmaps reveal combinations of weights for `GlobalQuadraticRE`, `GlobalLinearRE` and `LinearLocalRE`, where the relative share of full RE states among the outputs is acceptable. For `QuadraticLocalRE`, this holds at least for global optima. However, this does not constitute strong reasons to reject `QuadraticLocalRE`. Depending on the particular goals of an inquiry with RE, a low relative share of full RE states can be seen as a strength of a model, as it does not render everything into a full RE state.
