# Introduction

@beisbart_making_2021 introduced a formal model of reflective equilibrium based on the theory of dialectical structures [@betz_theorie_2010;@betz_debate_2013], which, according to them, can be used to better understand the method of reflective equilibrium and to assess its potential to yield better epistemic states. However, their discussion was based on a few illustrative examples only, without assessing how the model behaves under a wider spectrum of circumstances. 

This report summarizes findings of assessing the RE model more thouroughly by, first, running the model to determine fixed points of the RE process and calculating global optima under a wide range of configurations and, second, by tweaking the original model. The simulation outcomes of three model variants are compared to the ones of the original model.^[The results of @beisbart_making_2021 are based on a Mathematica implementation of the model (see <https://github.com/debatelab/remoma>). Here, we rely on a reimplementation in Python (LINK TO PUBLIC REPO).]
