This report summarizes findings of analysing a formal model of the method of reflective equilibrium. The model is based on @beisbart_making_2021.

In @sec-intro, we introduce the formal model of reflective equilibrium of @beisbart_making_2021 together with three variations of the original model that have been included in this report. We motivate the metrics for model validations that guide our assessment. Finally, we describe the ensemble of RE simulations that has been generated by the computer implementation of the formal model of RE.

In @sec-general-props, we present general results about the ensemble of RE simulation that form the basis of this report. They help to understand the model better,  and they ease the interpretation of aalient results, subsequently.

In @sec-go-and-fp, we provide results concerning the overlap of two outputs produced by the model: global optima and fixed points. They represent the static aspect of equilibrium states and the dynamic aspect of equilibration processes in RE, respectively.

In @sec-full-re-states, we present results concerning the attainment of full RE states which meet the highest standards for RE outputs. Full RE states represent outputs that can be understood to be justified by RE.

::: {.column width="70%"}
In @sec-commitment-consistency, we analyse different aspects of consistency pertaining to the outputs of the formal model. Commonly, consistency is considered to be a necessary requirement for coherence.

In @sec-extreme-values, we display outcomes regarding maximal values of measures of RE desiderata that guide the selection of states. This part of the analysis aims to foster understanding about the trade-offs in the formal model of RE.

## Reproducibility

All findings and the underlying data can be reproduced by using the [Python implementation]({{< var link.rethon >}}) of the model. The data that the model produced can be found [here]({{< var link.reproduction-data >}}). For each chapter you will find [here]({{< var link.reproduction-notebooks >}}) a Jupyter notebook whose execution produces all analysis results.
